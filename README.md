# Pizzeria client

This is the part of my project called **Pizzeria**.

[Live link](https://pizzeria-client-ab.vercel.app)

- It consists of one admin dashboard to manage products and another client-site in which customers can place orders. There were two separate applications, so I needed to create a separate server which can handle the load of both.

- [Pizzeria-server](https://github.com/MohitNishad/pizzeria-server)
- [Pizzeria-admin](https://github.com/MohitNishad/pizzeria-admin)

If you want to run this application locally, you need to have a running instance of Pizzeria-server and provide necessary environment variables:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
